<h1 class="section">2.4 Embryology Techniques</h1>
<h3 class="no-lines">Vitrification (cryopreservation) and embryo banking:</h3>
<p>Vitrification is an innovative flash-freezing technique for oocytes, embryos and ovarian tissue.  This fertility preservation procedure, which has a 98% survival rate, allows you to store surplus embryos created in one cycle for later use.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Genetic testing</h3>
<p>Numerous diseases and disorders classified as chromosomal disorders, single gene defects and sex-linked disorders can be tested for through a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).</p>

<p>PGD involves the removal and biopsy of several cells from the embryo when the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage.  At the day 3 stage, when the embryo consists of just six to eight cells, a single cell is removed.  Biopsies taken at the day 5 stage, when the embryo has about 100 cells, are more indicative.  At the day 5 stage, your doctor will remove three or four cells from the trophectoderm, the part of the blastocyst that will become the placenta.</p>

<p>PGD is performed for all single gene defects where the specific mutation is identifiable.  Analysis of the cells occurs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a diagnostic method used to show the number and arrangement of chromosomes.  PGD is an early screening technique and it does not entirely rule out the chance of a defect being present.  For this reason, PGD should be followed up with first-trimester screenings.</p>
