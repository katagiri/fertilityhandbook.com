<h1 class="section">2.7 Testicular Biopsy</h1>
<p>Testicular Biopsy may be helpful to determine the cause of male infertility. The procedure involves examining a tissue sample that contains seminiferous tubules that produce sperm under a microscope. The results may indicate correctable problems with the testis. If the testis is normal, there must be other sources for the infertility. During the procedure, the patient is under local anesthesia.</p>
