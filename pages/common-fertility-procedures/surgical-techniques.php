<h1 class="section">2.5 Surgical Techniques</h1>

<p>As discussed in the previous chapter, infertility can result from a number of mechanical and structural problems with the reproductive system that surgery may be able to correct.  Detailed below are some common procedures; a full listing of surgical treatments available at New Hope can be found in the Appendix.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)</h3>
<p>This radiology procedure is used to examine the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes and their surrounding environment.  A dye is inserted in a thin tube through vagina and into the uterus.  Images are taken using a fluoroscope as the dye passes through the uterus and fallopian tubes.  The resulting images are used to find any injuries, blockages or anatomical abnormalities.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Hysteroscopy</h3>
<p>A hysteroscopy is a procedure used to look at the inside of the uterus.  A camera called a hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina into the neck of the uterus and attached to a light source for visualization.  This surgical technique allows doctors to view the internal structures of the uterus without the need for an abdominal incision.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Myomectomy</h3>
<p>A myomectomy is performed to remove uterine fibroids and reconstruct the uterus.  Since the uterus is not removed in its entirety, this presents an alternative to a hysterectomy when suitable.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Ovarian Tissue Transfer</h3>
<p>If you are unable to produce viable eggs, ovarian tissue transfer is one donor option you might consider.  Tissue transfer involves removing the ovary of one woman, microsurgically dissecting the tissue, and subsequently transplanting it into another woman.  It can be a preferable alternative to egg donation because ovarian tissue has potentially thousands of eggs, and the tissue continues to function as a normal healthy ovary in your body long after the transfer.</p>

<h3 class="no-lines">Testicular Transplant</h3>
<p>Testicular transplant is a novel technique for men who have suffered the loss of a testicle.  This donor procedure may help restore reproductive capacity.  The resulting sperm will have the genetic traits of the donor.</p>
