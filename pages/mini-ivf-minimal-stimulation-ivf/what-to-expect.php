<h3 class="no-lines">Vitrification (cryopreservation) and embryo banking:</h3>
<p>During the initial consultation, you will meet with your personal care team to discuss your medical history, family goals and design a treatment plan tailored to your needs.</p>

<p>Your comprehensive fertility evaluation begins with a blood test to determine your FSH, estradiol, LH and progesterone levels, as well as a sonogram to determine your antral follicle count (AFC), which help dictate medication and treatment.  You will receive routine sonograms to confirm follicular sizes and quantity.  Subsequent blood tests and sonograms will aid in timing of the egg retrieval and establish a baseline for your endometrial lining thickness.  This baseline will eventually become indicative of the likelihood an embryo will implant on the uterine wall.  Sonogram and blood test results ultimately determine when you will begin your treatment cycle and which treatment you will benefit from the most.</p>
