<h1 class="section">4.3 Financial Considerations</h1>
<p>As part of your Personal Care Team, a Financial Coordinator is available to discuss all concerns about financing your treatment.  However, since each person receives an individualized treatment plan, you will receive your plan and pricing information during the initial consultation.  If applicable, prior to your initial consultation, we will contact your insurance provider to get a comprehensive understanding of your fertility coverage and when necessary, obtain all required pre-authorizations and file all in-network claims paperwork on your behalf.</p>
<p>During the initial consultation, your Financial Coordinator will also schedule payment for all fees not covered by your insurance, co-pays, out of network charges and deductibles.  All fees must be paid in full prior to starting your treatment course.  We accept cash, money orders and most major credit cards.</p>
